[20k] I'm working on it but latency is very high
[tukib] hol up just checking if this thing still works
[tukib] as a bonus this is a great learning exercise for those learning git
[tukib] perhaps this repository should be forked automatically for every single person with github education :)
[tukib] ok i have just sent several emails to github explaining my proposal. they should automatically send every day until they give a valid response such as "yes"
